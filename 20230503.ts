/* Write a SecondClock class, with two methods: start and reset.â€‹
start: upon invocation, invokes a callback (this.cb, defined in the constructor) on an argument every second, with the argument to the callback being the current seconds "value".

In other words, the callback gets invoked every second on the "seconds hand" of the clock. Always start with 1 and don't utilize the seconds value of the current computer clock time.

The first "tick" with value 1 occurs 1 second after the initial "secondClock" invocation.
The second "tick" with value 2 occurs 2 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.
...
The sixtieth "tick" with value 60 occurs 60 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.
The sixty-first "tick" with value 1 occurs 61 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.
The sixty-second "tick" with value 2 occurs 62 seconds after the initial "secondClock" invocation.
etc.
reset: upon invocation, completely stops the "clock".
Also resets the time back to the beginning. */
